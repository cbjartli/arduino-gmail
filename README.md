This is a simple instructional Arduino project made while co-teaching INFO361 / Advanced Topics in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Bergen. In this project, the students were asked to come up with situations where tangible user interfaces could be beneficial, and then to carry through the design of a prototype of one such TUI. The students were instructed in the use of design and prototyping tools, and the Arduino platform. 

This project is meant to serve as an example of a simple embedded device software project. The code has been written as close to pure C as possible, with minimal use of C++-specific functionality.
